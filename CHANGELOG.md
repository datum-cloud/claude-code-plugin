# Changelog

Notable changes to the Datum Cloud Claude Code plugins.

## [1.8.0] - 2026-05-04

### Added

- **Release skill** (`release`) — Generates GitHub releases for any datum-cloud service repository. Auto-detects project type (CRD-based operator or aggregated API server), collects merged PRs since the last release, diffs schema/type files to determine compatibility, drafts release notes in the established style, and publishes via `gh release create`. Supports `--patch`, `--minor`, `--major`, and `--draft` flags.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-04-30

### Changed

- **GitHub conventions skill** (`pr-conventions`) — Expanded from PR-only guidance to cover issues and comments. PRs must now link to an issue. Avoid using `Closes`/`Closed` — use `Fixes` or `Resolves` only when intentionally closing. Issue descriptions focus on goals and desired outcomes; technical discussion belongs in comments. Adds GitHub callout syntax guidance and a rule to always use descriptive link text.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-04-12

### Added

- **Operational review skill** (`operational-review`) — Guides the SRE agent through producing weekly traffic and latency ops review reports for the global Envoy edge ingress. Covers VictoriaMetrics queries for RPS and latency (P50/P90/P95) globally and per-POP, anomaly detection thresholds, and publishing structured reports as pull requests to `datum-cloud/engineering`.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-02-20

### Added

- **PR conventions skill** (`pr-conventions`) — Standardized pull request description guidelines covering structure, required sections, and content guidance. Defines Summary, Test plan, and Breaking changes sections. Agents prompt for context when PR purpose is unclear.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-02-20

### Added

- **Commit conventions skill** (`commit-conventions`) — Standardized commit message guidelines based on the seven rules from cbea.ms/git-commit. Provides format, structure, and content guidance for consistent commit history across repositories. Agents prompt for clarification when commit purpose is unclear.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-02-20

### Added

- **Feature gates pattern** (`k8s-apiserver-patterns`) — Guidance for safely introducing experimental features with Alpha/Beta/GA lifecycle stages. Helps API developers ship new capabilities incrementally while giving operators runtime control via `--feature-gates` flags.
